# Debug: Read Issue Analysis

## Problem
115 keys that were written cannot be found when reading them back in the benchmark test.

## Possible Causes

1. **Environment Lookup Issue**: Different environment instances for read/write
2. **Key Encoding**: Keys might be encoded differently during write vs read
3. **Transaction Visibility**: Even after removing NO_SYNC, there might be other visibility issues
4. **Path Resolution**: The path resolution logic might be interfering

## Investigation Steps

1. Check if the same environment instance is used for both operations
2. Verify key encoding is consistent
3. Check if transactions are properly committed
4. Test with simpler keys to isolate the issue

## Key Observations

- The benchmark writes keys like "key-1", "key-2", etc.
- It then reads random keys using rand:uniform
- 115 failures out of presumably 1000+ operations is significant
- This worked with other stores (fs, lmdb, lru)
